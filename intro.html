<h1>Amit and Deepa are a young married couple living in a housing society. Shashank, is another member living in the same society. Amit, Deepa and Shashank were friends since college. This was when Amit and Deepa started dating. Shashank always had a thing for Deepa which nobody really knew except for Deepa. Sometimes he would harass her tell her to leave Amit, and often even try to forcefully hold her hand. She never told Amit or anyone else about this. Years passed, she and Amit got married. This pissed Shashank off. He turned psychopathic and felt the need to do something to teach them both a lesson which is one of the reasons he moved to the same colony to keep an eye on them.
Amit’s job includes working from home while Deepa needs to travel often. One afternoon, when Deepa went on one of her one day trips, Shashank went to meet Amit. He made up and excuse of not getting hot water at his place and entered the house. Amit being a friendly neighbour, told Shashank to help himself in the kitchen and went back to working. Shashank entered the kitchen, found a hammer, snuck up behind Amit’s chair and whacked Amit’s head several times until Amit stopped breathing. Shashank had a big smile on his face covered in splatters of blood. He took the hammer and sprinted back to his house. This is where you come in. Shashank has hired you as his acquaintance and you need to help him frame Deepa for Amit’s murder so that she suffers.
You will follow a couple of tasks given by Shashank to you on Whatsapp and you will have to execute them to frame Deepa.
